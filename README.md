# Earth View With Esri
An application to browse and download images of pre-selected locations using the latest ESRI's high resolution imagery.  The list of locations is curated by [Google](http://earthview.withgoogle.com/) while the layer used on the map as a base to export images is ESRI's [World Imagery](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=10df2279f9684e4a9f6a7f08febac2a9) with resolutions as high as 15m!
